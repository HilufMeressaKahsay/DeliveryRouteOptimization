The time complexity of Problem in Java will depend on the specific algorithm being used.

Here are the time complexities of for the Delivery company Problem:
Nearest Neighbor: The nearest neighbor algorithm starts at a random city and repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited buildings until all buildings have been visited. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of buildings. This is because finding the nearest unvisited buildings requires iterating through the entire list of buildings.

The space complexity of Problem in Java will depend on the specific algorithm being used.

Here are the space complexities of heuristic algorithms for the Delivery company Problem:
Nearest Neighbor: The nearest neighbor algorithm starts at a random buildings and repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited builidings until all buildings have been visited. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of buildings. This is because only the current buildings and the list of unvisited buildings need to be stored in memory.
